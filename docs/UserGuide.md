## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TAG`, `t/TAG n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John n/Joe`, only `n/Joe` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Viewing help : `help`

The newly added person will be placed at the top of the contact list.

`add n/John Doe d/Telegram, johndoe`
`add n/Betsy Crowe d/Phone, 99900099 d/Email, e0123456@gmail.com`

### Locating persons by name : `[find]`

If the first keyword is a command word, it will still be recognised as a command and will not be treated as keywords. The whole list will be displayed when a command word is entered.  
  
The keywords are compared to all fields of each person.  
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.  
The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.  
The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.  

**Examples:**

`find a` will return `Alex Yeoh`, `Bernice` with the tag `colleagues`, `Lin` with the email `lin@example.com` (if these contacts exist).  
`a` does the same as above.  
`find alex yeoh` will return both `Alex` and `Alex Yeoh` (if both contacts exist).  
When the user types `add`, the whole list is displayed.
